arc-desktop
-----------

The Arc Desktop is the successor to the Budgie Desktop, with a focus
on modern style and function.

Note that this work will be merged *back* into the Budgie Desktop
repo on GitHub upon completion - the name-change is SOLELY to make
it parallel installable and help me with debugging.
