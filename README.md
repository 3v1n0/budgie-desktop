Components
==========

Budgie Desktop consists of a number of components to provide a more complete desktop experience.

Main Menu
---------

The main Budgie menu provides a quick and easy to use menu, suitable for both mouse and keyboard driven users. Features type-as-you-search and category based filtering.

Run Dialog
----------

The run dialog provides the means to quickly find an application in a popup window. This window by default is activated with the `ALT+F2` keyboard shortcut, providing keyboard driven launcher facilities.

Raven
------

Raven provides an all-in-one center for the Budgie Desktop. With built in applets, a notification center to archive missed notifications, and a settings view to control all elements of the Budgie Desktop, it's truly the one stop shop.

Notifications
-------------

Budgie Desktop supports the freedesktop notifications specification, enabling applications to send visual alerts to the user. These notifications support actions, icons as well as passive modes.

To ensure the user doesn't miss the notification, it's automatically archived into the Raven Notification view for quick and easy access.

Media Integration
------------------

As well as supporting the usual level of media integration you'd expect, such as media player controls on notifications, support for cover artwork, and global media key support for keyboards, Raven supports all MPRIS compliant media players.

When one of these players are running, such as VLC, Rhythmbox or even Spotify, an MPRIS controller is made available in Raven for quick and simple control of the player, as well as data on the current media selection.

PolicyKit integration
---------------------

The `budgie-polkit-dialog` provides a PolicyKit agent for the session, ensuring a cohesive and integrated experience whilst authenticating for actions on modern Linux desktop systems.

Theming
------

Please look at `./src//3.20/sass` and `./src/theme/3.18/sass` to override aspects of the default theming. Budgie theming is created using SASS, and the CSS files shipped are minified. Check out `./src/theme/README.md` for more information on regenerating the theme from SASS.

Alternatively, you may invoke the panel with the GTK Inspector to analyse the structure:

```bash
budgie-panel --gtk-debug=interactive --replace
```

If you are validating changes from a git clone, then:

```bash
./src/panel/budgie-panel --gtk-debug=interactive --replace
```

Note that for local changes, GSettings schemas and applets are expected to be installed first with `make install`.

Note that it is intentional for the toplevel `BudgiePanel` object to be transparent, as it contains the `BudgieMainPanel` and `BudgieShadowBlock` within a singular window.

Also note that by default Budgie overrides all theming with the stylesheet, and in future we'll also make it possible for you to set a custom theme. To do this, test your changes in tree first. When you have a reasonable theme put together, please open an issue and we'll enable setting of a custom theme (no point until they exist.)

Testing
------

As and when new features are implemented - it can be helpful to reset the configuration to the defaults to ensure everything is still working ok. To reset the entire configuration tree, issue:

```bash
budgie-panel --reset --replace &
```
